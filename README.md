# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detector

A machine learning model that detects brain tumors from MRI images with ~90% accuracy and classifies them as **benign** or **malignant**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Classifies MRI scans into:
  - **No Tumor**
  - **Benign Tumor**
  - **Malignant Tumor**
- Achieves **90% accuracy** with a **5% error rate**
- Uses deep learning (CNN) for image classification
- Jupyter notebook implementation with dataset preprocessing, training, and evaluation
